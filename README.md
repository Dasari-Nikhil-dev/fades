# ðŸ”µ Fades

**Fades** is a modern image feed & stories Android app built with Kotlin, XML, and clean architecture. It uses the **Imgur API** to display dynamic image feeds and Instagram-style auto-playing stories based on categories like `hot`, `top`, and popular tags like `funny`, `meme`, etc.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### 1. Navigation

The app has two main tabs: **Hot** and **Top**, accessible via bottom navigation.

Each tab shows:
- A **horizontal story section** (auto-playing every 5 seconds)
- A **vertical feed** of image posts below

---

### 2. Data Fetching

- On launch, the app fetches data from **Imgur's API** using Retrofit.
- Images are rendered in `RecyclerView` using a custom adapter.
- The top stories are selected from the feed and auto-scroll automatically.

---

### 3. Auto-Playing Stories

- No user action needed.  
- Every **5 seconds**, the story viewer automatically switches to the next image.
- This mimics the behavior seen in apps like Instagram.
